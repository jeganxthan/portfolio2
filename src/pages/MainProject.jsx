When a client sends a message, the WebSocket server publishes it to Redis, which then distributes it to all other subscribed WebSocket servers. Each server broadcasts the message to its connected clients, ensuring that all users stay in sync. Nginx acts as a load balancer to distribute client connections across multiple WebSocket servers, enabling horizontal scalability and preventing a single server from being overloaded. This architecture makes the system fault-tolerant, scalable, and efficient for building real-time applications like chat apps, notifications, or collaborative tools.",

Leveraging the Google Gemini API, the system delivers AI-powered interactive Q&A, enabling users to query their resumes dynamically. The application implements JWT-based authentication for secure access and email verification with Flask-Mail to ensure account authenticity. All data is stored securely using PostgreSQL and managed through SQLAlchemy ORM. Real-time communication is supported via Flask-SocketIO with Eventlet, enabling live private messaging between users. The system also features a responsive, clean UI and optimized backend performance for fast processing of resume uploads and queries. By combining AI-driven insights, secure authentication, real-time messaging, and efficient data parsing, this Resume Bot serves as a comprehensive career assistance tool for modern job seekers.",
